 Microservices is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanism, built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.


Microservices with Spring Cloud:

Small autonomous services that work together.

* REST
* Small well chosen deployable units
* Cloud Enabled

Challenges with Microservices:

1) Bounded Context
2) Configuration Management
3) Dynamic Scale Up And Scale Down
4) Visibility
5) Pack Of Cards

Introduction to Spring Cloud:

Configuration Management: 

-> Spring Cloud Config Server backed up by git 


Dynamic Scale Up and Scale Down:

* Naming Server(Eureka) - Service Registeration, Service Discovery
* Ribbon(Client Side Load Balancing)
* Feign(Easier REST Clients)


Ribbon Load Balancing

Visibility and Monitoring:

-> Zipkin Distributed Tracing.
-> Netflix API Gateway.

Fault Tolrance:

Hystrix

Advantages Of MicroServices:

New Technology and Process Adaption

Dynamic Scaling

Faster Release Cycles
